# Startup
Current plan:<br />
Step 1: Get a list of websites/webpages(preferably) which includes the service coupons of the automobile center in either text or image format. This will be performed using the yellow pages API.<br />
Step 2: Crawl these webpages and find out the services offered<br />
        - We may have to find the services web page from the website or we just have record of the webpage which has the services       page(later saves us a bunch o time)<br />
        - We categorize the service page to be in the form of photos or text<br />
        - After categorization we extract the features which could be prices, coupons, rebates. (We need to deicde on the list of features)<br />
        - The above extracted features need to be put in a csv file which the app will use<br />
Step 3: The app reads the csv file and shows the captured information based on place, state, etc(more info can be added to the classification part here that is place, state and more based on the data we gather)<br />


Please continue adding detailed approaches when performing the tasks and keep updating this so that we are in sync<br />
